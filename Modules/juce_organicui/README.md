# juce_organicui
A massive JUCE module that adds multiple UI and control features


## Important note

Because my pull requests on the official JUCE repo have not been reviewed yet, if you're using this module you will need to use the **develop-local** branch of my JUCE fork :

```
git clone --branch=develop-local https://github.com/benkuper/JUCE
```
